        “At the beginning of a new start, be a brave challenger, who looks upon oneself continuously and becomes a pioneer of his own life, and who expresses himself and puts social values up front,” said President Ryu as he addressed the graduates. “By sharing your knowledge and abilities to those around you, make us proud by being a Seoul National University graduate who is also the leader our society needs, and a respected intellectual,” he added.
